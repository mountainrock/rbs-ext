RBS(Reverse bidding script) is a free software Licensed under GPL (Published by free software foundation).

You can use RBS as a bidding system where buyers can post their requirements and sellers can post their bids, along with their expertise.

The original creator of this php script is [Cogzidel](http://www.cogzidel.com/products/rbs).

We aim to organize this open source code here as RBS lacks version management, wiki and bug tracking.

Aim:

  1. Prioritize features, cleanup code and fix bugs.
  1. Maintain code in SVN.
  1. Maintain bug tracker.
  1. Maintain wiki
  1. Add new features
  1. Release new builds.
  1. Host demo site for each new version which is built(on bluehost)
